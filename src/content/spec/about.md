# About
Hello! I’m 0xc60f, a college student who likes to code and make things. I’m currently studying Computer Science and Statistics at the University of British Columbia.

## History

I got started with programming when I was introduced to Scratch, and now it’s stuck a lot. Currently, I’m working on a few projects, including this website, a multipurpose Discord bot, and a new grade tracker for Powershell school districts.

Some of my interests include:

- Jailbreaking/Modding (I’ve modded every console in my house save for my Switch OLED)
- Software Development
- Biking and Exploring Nature Trails (lots in Vancouver)
- CAD and 3D Printing (I’ve done a bit of 3D printing working for engineering design teams)
- Video Games (The 3 main franchises I adore are *Sonic the Hedgehog*, *Zenless Zone Zero*, and *Xenoblade Chronicles*)
