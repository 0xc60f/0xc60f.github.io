# Finally, I Realized Had a Website

After about 8 months of having a website, I finally realized I had one. I decided to write a blog post about it.

## Why Did It Take So Long?

Well, college applications and senior year really caught up to me. The consequences of my actions, just like the
nursery rhyme. Too much going on, not enough time to manage it all. But at least I'm back.

## Why Am I Back Now?

A pretty dumb reason to be honest. The domain name was expiring and I didn't want to lose it.
So after spending about a week breaking my head over transferring domains through Github, I managed to switch
the domain to .me and here we are.

## What's Next?

I've had quite a few ideas for what I want to write, considering senioritis is in full swing.

- A post about my college application process, my personal experience, and advice for future applicants
- Quite a bit of posts about my personal projects, including a few that I've been working on for a while.
  - One of them is Hehe Utilities, a Discord bot I've been working on for the past year. I've wanted to document working on the bot for a while, so I'll probably start with that.
  - More posts will talk about my other posts, like this [pathfinder](https://github.com/0xc60f/Google-Maps-Pathfinder) I made a year ago.

Well, that's all for now. I promise I'll be back sometime this year ðŸ˜….
