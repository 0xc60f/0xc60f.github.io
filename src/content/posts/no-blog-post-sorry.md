# No Blog Post This Week, Sorry
I actually had a pretty interesting post related to iOS jailbreaking and Screen Time planned, but I have final exams coming up and
unfortunately didn't have the time to finish it before today, but since I wanted to get in the habit of using this website more than
once in a blue moon, I've updated [my Nitter article](/posts/setting-up-nitter-with-nginx) to make the instructions clearer.
Hopefully in the future I'll be able to make instructions clearer so that I don't need to make an update like this. However, I've 
got a lot of cool ideas that I've already drafted, and this summer I'll be able to write much more. Have a good week!
