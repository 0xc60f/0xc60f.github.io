# Quick Update

Hello, sorry for the slightly late post!

I've been a bit busy, moreso lazy, right now with summer, so it's
been a bit hard to write a blog post as of right now, so for this week
I'll keep it short. The Zenless Zone Zero 2.0 update came out, and I've been
spending a LOT of time on it, thankfully they cooked. And with the new merch collab
with Beard Papa, hopefully I can snag both a Burnice and Anby stand.

_I forgot to screenshot Yi Xuan herself, but I did get a screenshot of her engine._

Hopefully the motivation will come back to me soon enough, but I'll leave you with some photos 
I got at Wreck Beach recently.
