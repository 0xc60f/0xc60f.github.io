# New Website 2: Electric Boogaloo

You've definitely noticed the site looks different, and that's because
I spent a couple hours migrating my posts to [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari), a more
aesthetically pleasing blog theme than AstroPaper. Also, AstroPaper was thinning out some features
that I liked, so this is a nice alternative. There may be some stuff broken, but I'll probably find it
and fix it on my own. Also, RSS works now, which is helpful since I've gotten into it recently.

Nothing much else to say, just have a midterm soon in a class I am barely paying attention to.

See you in 2 weeks!
