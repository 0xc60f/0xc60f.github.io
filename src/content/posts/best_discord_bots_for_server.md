# My Discord Bot Setup

I've been a moderator for a Youtuber's Discord server for a while now, and I've suggested and set up a few bots to help make the server feel lively. 
Here are the bots I use and what I use them for.

## Carl-bot

Carl-bot is a general-purpose bot that can do a lot of things. It has a lot of moderation commands, like banning, kicking, and muting users, as well as a lot of utility commands like a calculator, a reminder system, and a poll system. 
There are some premium features that I wish weren't locked, such as leveling so that I didn't need Arcane, it does work almost perfectly for our needs.
## Arcane

Arcane's best feature, and the one that I've implemented as a moderator, is a leveling system. Users can gain experience by chatting in the server, and they can level up to unlock new roles and permissions. It's a great way to keep users engaged in the server.
Arcane can be a bit of a hassle to set up, but it is worth it in the end, as it mostly runs on its own once it's set up.
## MonitoRSS

I need to pull from a Twitter account for a video game in order to keep the server's members updated on
the events in the game, but I don't want to manually post every tweet. In addition, Twitter's exorbtiant 
prices for API access make any existing bots, such as [Tweetshift](https://tweetshift.com/), unfeasible.
Instead, I use MonitoRSS to pull from a [Nitter](https://nitter.net/) feed, which is a Twitter frontend
that strips away all the tracking and ads. MonitoRSS is a great bot for pulling from RSS feeds, and it's
easy to set up. The free limit is generous, the bot is reliable, and there's always a self-hosted version
if you want to go past the free limits.

## QOTD Bot

QOTD Bot is a simple bot that posts a question of the day every day. It's a great way to keep the server active and engaged, and it's a fun way to get to know the other members of the server.
While the bot doesn't come with questions of its own, community members can submit their own questions through decks, which allows me to add a lot
of questions to the feed at once, so I can set it and forget it.
In addition, the bot has a lot of customization options, such as the ability to set the time the question is posted, the channel it's posted in, and the ability to make a new thread for every question posted,
which is very useful for keeping the channel clean.

## Conclusion
You really don't need a lot of members to have a lively server. With the right bots and the right community, you can have a server that feels alive and active, even with only a few members.
I hope you took away something useful from this post, it was mainly me describing very shortly what I like about the bots I use.
