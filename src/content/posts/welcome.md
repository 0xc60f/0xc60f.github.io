# Welcome Back!

I've been meaning to get back into blogging for a while, and what better way
to do so than with a new style. It's similar to the last one, but with a lot
of extra features and QOL updates that I can expand on. Even right now the website
is a bit barebones, but I'll make sure to add more as time goes on. However, I'm not reuploading
the old posts because:

1. They're quite old (and had inaccuracies which I would not want to change)
2. I want to start writing posts (and the new diary) in a different way
3. I'm too lazy to actually migrate all the posts

However, there's a lot that's changed, so I'll get around to writing about it. There are some
nice features that this template offers that I'll add soon, just wanted to get this off the ground.
I'm also moving this to be hosted on Cloudflare Pages. I already pay for a domain from them,
so seems worth it to also move website hosting to them.

Other than that, hope to see you soon (if I remember)!
